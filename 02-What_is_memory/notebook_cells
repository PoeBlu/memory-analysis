  - The diagram is of an old Z80 computer (made in 1980)! Back in those days memory
    was used directly by the CPU. As the diagram shows, when the CPU wants to read
    a byte from memory, the CPU dials up the correct address on the *address bus*
    and then simply reads the data from the *data bus*. Those were the good old simple
    days.
  - ''
  - Today we have more abstractions behind memory but the concept is similar - there
    is an address bus connecting to the RAM chip itself, and when  an address is dialed
    up on the bus, the data bus will contain the data. These days however, the CPU
    is not directly connected to the RAM chip, but goes through a Memory Management
    Unit (MMU).
  - ''
  - Another interesting thing to note is that Read Only Memory (ROM) and peripherals
    are sharing the address bus and data buses with the RAM chip. What this means
    is that when the address bus contains addresses in certain ranges, different devices
    put data on the data bus. For example say that the RAM chip will only answer to
    addresses between the ranges 0x1000-0x2000, then only when the address bus contains
    addresses in that range, will the RAM chip attempt to control (i.e. inject electric
    current on) the data bus. For other addresses the RAM chip will ignore the address
    bus completely, as if it is not present at all.
  - ''
  - This scheme allows multiple different devices to be connected to the same address
    and data buses as long as they are mapped (i.e. respond to) different address
    ranges.

  - '### What happens when the system boots?'
  - ''
  - When the system boots the bios needs to map all devices into the address bus.
    Obviously if different devices are mapped to the same address ranges, this can
    damage the system because they will both be trying to control (i.e. inject electric
    current) on the data bus in the same time (it can actually burn out the memory
    chip drivers if this happens!).
  - ''
  - So the bios needs to program the different devices to ensure they do not overlap.
    In modern systems, the BIOS does not actually map memory mapped IO devices (this
    is left to the operating system), but the BIOS needs to program the RAM chips
    into their respective ranges, while at the same time reserving regions for the
    OS's PnP facilities to actually map devices DMA into.
  - ''
  - Therefore the BIOS will build an initial **Physical Memory Layout map**. The BIOS
    (The Northbridge) then conveys this information to the operating system during
    system boot - specifically which regions are *available* for the OS to use and
    which are *reserved* for DMA mappings.
  - ''
  - 'The figure below shows a typical BIOS memory map on the left, and a typical final
    mapping as configured by the operating system''s plug and play facilities:'

  - It should be noted that the BIOS may not actually map physical RAM memory to the
    reserved regions. They are just gaps in the address space where PCI devices should
    map their DMA buffers. Since RAM is a scarce resource, the BIOS should generally
    not waste it on reserved areas. On the other hand some PCI devices only have a
    32bit address bus, and therefore there must be a large enough region reserved
    below the 4Gb limit to allow these to be mapped.
  - ''
  - 'It follows then, that the largest accessible physical memory address is going
    to be much larger than the contents of RAM in the system (since reserved gaps
    will expand it). '
  - ''
  - This is often a confusing point for people who acquire images in the RAW format
    - why is the size of the image much larger than the amount of RAM installed? This
    is because the RAW format must pad reserved regions with zeros (to maintain alignment).
  - ''
  - '### What happens when we read inside the reserved areas?'
  - ''
  - We know that the regions marked *available* are available for the OS to use and
    are backed by suitable RAM chips. But what happens when we read outside this?
    Often nothing at all! If there is no RAM chip mapped at this region, there is
    nothing there at all - When you read from it you get zeros.
  - ''
  - However sometimes there is a PCI DMA region mapped into the reserved region. What
    happens when we read from that? Looking back at the first diagram we can see that
    when the address bus contains the value of the address in the reserved region,
    the PCI device configured to respond to that address may activate. At this point
    anything is really possible since the hardware expects that the data bus will
    contain valid data to act on. Usually the hardware will detect an error and the
    machine will either bluescreen or crash hard.
  - ''
  - It is therefore dangerous for imaging tools to try to read from the reserved regions
    - in case there are DMA devices mapped there. Most imaging tools avoid these regions
    by first asking the kernel about them (e.g. in windows an API callem MmGetPhysicalAddressRanges).
  - ''
  - It is quite trivial for malware to manipulate the data structures that the kernel
    maintains about the physical layout. This can easily fool memory analysis tools.
  - ''
  - Another interesting property we can see in the image above is that it is possible
    to have some hidden memory inside the reserved regions. Sometimes due to RAM address
    alignment limitations, the BIOS will overlap some of the reserved region with
    RAM chips. In that case writing to that region will actually maintain data (i.e.
    a read operation will recover the original data). In this case it is possible
    to store some non-trivial data in regions where memory imagers do not dare to
    read.

  - '# Memory acquisition'
  - ''
  - How do we acquire memory? Acquision methods are broadly divided into hardware
    and software methods.
  - ''
  - '## Hardware based memory acquisition.'
  - ''
  - Although in the past it was possible to acquire memory via Firewire, or a special
    PCI device, in reality these methods are no longer practical. Acquisition through
    Firewire is brittle, but even when it works it is only possible to acquire the
    lower 4Gb of RAM, which on modern systems is just not enough.
  - ''
  - By far the most practical way for acquiring memory in hardware is through Virtual
    Machines. When a guest VM is running inside a virtualization solution, it is often
    possible to pause the VM and perfectly preserve the state of (virtual) RAM. This
    is quite a unique ability and actually produces a perfect memory image.
  - ''
  - '## Software based memory acquisition.'
  - ''
  - If the target we need to acquire is not running inside a virtualization solution,
    we must use a software aquision technique. This is a program running within the
    target which copies out physical memory into an image file.
  - ''
  - '### Image file format.'
  - ''
  - Before we consider the different memory imaging tools, let us first examine how
    the image is stored - the image file format.
  - ''
  - 'By far the simplest image file format is the RAW format. In this format, the
    physical address space is written byte for byte directly into the image file. '
  - ''
  - '* Pros:'
  - '  * RAW files are very very simple, no special requirements are needed to read
    the file.'
  - ''
  - '* Cons:'
  - '  * No ability to store sparse regions - all reserved regions must be padded
    in the image with zeros giving a larger image size.'
  - '  * No support for compression, encryption etc.'
  - '  * No support for additional metadata.'
  - '  * No support for embedding additional files, such as the pagefile, kernel image
    etc.'
  - ''
  - 'For this reason there are a number of different file formats employed:'
  - ''
  - 1. The Microsoft Crashdump file, for example, is commonly used with windows images
    - however this is a proprietary, undocumented file format with no support for
    compression or embedding (although it supports some windows specific metadata)
    it is also non-extensible. We do not recommend acquiring with this format directly
    - if you need to analyze the image with the windows debugger we recommend using
    the Rekall **raw2dmp** plugin to create a dump file later.
  - 2. An ELF core file is the standard image format used by GDB and Linux when making
    a core dump. This format allows the storage of sparse memory regions, but has
    only limited support for extensible metadata. It is not possible to use this format
    to collect related files (like the pagefile, kernel image etc). This format is
    the default produced by versions of Rekall's *pmem* acquisition tools prior to
    version 2.0. Certain virtualization tools like Virtual Box produce memory images
    in this format so it can still be useful.
  - 3. EWF is a compression format which is used by Encase. It offers the ability
    for the image to be compressed but does not support sparse files, nor multiple
    streams (at least the versions supported by the open source libewf tool).
  - '4. Various ad-hoc imaging formats that are sometimes used. Rekall can read those
    if you receive them in this format:'
  - ' * Limes - an ad-hoc imaging format sometimes used on Linux.'
  - ' * HPAK - A propritary format used in HBGary''s tools.'
  - ' * Mach-O - This is the binary format used on OSX. These kind of images used
    to be produced by the now defunct "Mac Memory Reader".'
  - ''
  - 'After version 2.0 Rekall''s pmem suite of acquisition tools have switched to
    the AFF4 format for the default image format. AFF4 is:'
  - ''
  - '* A peer reviewed open standard for storing digital images.'
  - '* Supports compression using the Zlib and Snappy protocols - allows imaging at
    speeds greated than 300mb/s.'
  - '* Supports storing arbitrary metadata via RDF information triples.'
  - '* The image file format is a simple Zip file, with all the advantages that brings:'
  - '  * Readily available tools for recovery of corrupted image files.'
  - '  * Readily available tools for inspection, verification and manipulation of
    the image format.'
  - '  * Built in support in almost every programming language - decompressing an
    AFF4 stream can be done in 4 lines of python without the use of the AFF4 library.'
  - ''

  - '##  AFF4 overview.'
  - ''
  - Why did Rekall decide to switch to AFF4 as the standard imaging format? One of
    the reasons we started writing imaging tools inside the Rekall project was to
    provide a full end-to-end imaging + analysis solution for memory forensics needs.
    As we developed more features into our imaging tools we found that we can exploit
    the synergy between the acquisition and analysis parts of the project, in order
    to make analysis more powerful. Put simply, we can make our analysis simpler and
    more robust if we can collect more information at collection time.
  - ''
  - For example there is a lot of code in Rekall to try to guess the version of the
    kernel which is running in the image. But the imager already knows this because
    it can just call an API to ask about it! Rekall is in a unique position to simply
    get the imager to collect additional information, saving the analysis part from
    figuring out this detail.
  - ''
  - We therefore wanted an imaging format which we can use to store arbitrary metadata,
    and that we can extend very easily.
  - ''
  - Similarly, as we developed Rekall's analysis capabilities we realized that the
    pagefile is extremely important in the analysis of userspace programs. We then
    wanted to also collect the pagefile by default. AFF4 allows us to store multiple
    streams in the same image. So we can store all the pagefiles, the physical memory
    stream, the kernel image and all the drivers on the system in the same AFF4 file
    (in AFF4 terminology it is called an AFF4 volume).
